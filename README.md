## Building the Draft

Formatted text and HTML versions of the draft can be built using `make`.

```sh
$ make
```

This requires that you have the necessary software installed.  See [the
instructions](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/master/doc/SETUP.md).


## Contributing

Be aware that all contributions to the specification fall under the "NOTE WELL"
terms outlined below.

1. The best way to provide feedback (editorial or design) and ask questions is
sending an e-mail to our mailing list
([http](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/httpbis) or [quic](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/quic)).
This will ensure that the entire Working Group sees your input in a timely fashion.

2. If you have **editorial** suggestions (i.e., those that do not change the
meaning of the specification), you can either:

  a) Fork this repository and submit a pull request; this is the lowest
  friction way to get editorial changes in.

  b) Submit a new issue to Github, and mention that you believe it is editorial
  in the issue body. It is not necessary to notify the mailing list for
  editorial issues.

  c) Make comments on individual commits in Github. Note that this feedback is
  processed only with best effort by the editors, so it should only be used for
  quick editorial suggestions or questions.

3. For non-editorial (i.e., **design**) issues, you can also create an issue on
Github. However, you **must notify the mailing list** when creating such issues,
providing a link to the issue in the message body.

  Note that **github issues are not for substantial discussions**; the only
  appropriate place to discuss design issues is on the mailing list itself.


## NOTE WELL

Any submission to the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) intended by the Contributor
for publication as all or part of an IETF Internet-Draft or RFC and any

well as written and electronic communications made at any time or place, which
are addressed to:

 * The IETF plenary session
 * The IESG, or any member thereof on behalf of the IESG

Statements made outside of an IETF session, mailing list or other function,
that are clearly not intended to be input to an IETF activity, group or
