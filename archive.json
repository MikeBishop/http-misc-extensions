The former prevents us from setting the SNI to an unrelated domain, but the latter allows an active adversary to observe the CERTIFICATE_REQUEST frame and learn the true destination.\r\n\r\nThis change splits the difference, making the rule \"require the certificate to validate for the SNI or for the origin\".  This implicitly relies on TLS 1.3 to hide the origin's certificate if the SNI is an unrelated domain.",

          "body": "You're correct that RFC6066 explicitly prohibits IP literals in the SNI extension (at least in the HostName field, which is what we care about.)  On the other hand, saying that if the value of the SNI is an IP literal, it's equivalent to an empty string, that's a little odd, too.  I think these are the relevant combinations:\r\n\r\n| Alternative | SNI param | Outcome |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Hostname | Hostname | Fine; domain fronting |\r\n| Hostname | IP literal | Invalid...? |\r\n| Hostname | Empty string | Fine; expect an IP-bound certificate |\r\n| IP literal | Hostname | Fine; expect an SNI-bound certificate |\r\n| IP literal | IP literal | Invalid...? |\r\n| IP literal | Empty string | Fine; expect an IP-bound certificate |\r\n\r\nI think the takeaway is that the value in `sni` MUST be either a hostname or the empty string, and it has nothing to do with whether the alternative is given as a hostname or an IP literal.  Perhaps we just change it from `host` to `reg-name` and keep the same reference to 3986?",
