                draft-bishop-httpbis-altsvc-quic-latest

Abstract

   The ALTSVC and ORIGIN frames for HTTP/2 are equally applicable to
   HTTP/3, but need to be separately registered.  This document
   describes the ALTSVC and ORIGIN frames for HTTP/3.

1.  Introduction

   Existing RFCs define extensions to HTTP/2 which remain useful in
   HTTP/3.  Appendix A.2.3 of [HTTP3] describes the required updates for
   HTTP/2 frames to be used with HTTP/3.

   [ALTSVC] defines HTTP Alternative Services, which allow an origin's
   resources to be authoritatively available at a separate network
   location, possibly accessed with a different protocol configuration.
   It defines two mechanisms for transporting such information, an HTTP
   response header and an HTTP/2 frame type.

   [ORIGIN] defines the HTTP/2 ORIGIN frame, which indicates what
   origins are available on a given connection.  It defines a single
   HTTP/2 frame type.

2.  Basic Mapping Conventions

   Where HTTP/2 reserves Stream 0 for frames related to the state of the
   connection, HTTP/3 defines a pair of unidirectional streams called
   "control streams" for this purpose.  Where the existing RFCs indicate
   that a frame should be sent on Stream 0, this should be interpreted
   to mean the HTTP/3 control stream.

3.  The ALTSVC HTTP/3 Frame

   The ALTSVC HTTP/3 frame advertises the availability of an alternative
   service to an HTTP/3 client.

   An ALTSVC frame from a server to a client on the server's control
   stream indicates that the conveyed alternative service is associated
   with the origin contained in the Origin field of the frame.

Internet-Draft         HTTP/2 Extensions in HTTP/3             July 2020


   An ALTSVC frame from a server to a client on a stream other than the
   control stream indicates that the conveyed alternative service is
   associated with the origin of that stream.

   The layout and semantics of the frame payload are identical to those
   of the HTTP/2 frame defined in [ALTSVC].  The ALTSVC frame type is
   0xa (decimal 10), as in HTTP/2.

4.  The ORIGIN HTTP/3 Frame

   The ORIGIN HTTP/3 frame allows a server to indicate what origin(s)
   ([RFC6454]) the server would like the client to consider as members
   of the Origin Set (Section 2.3 of [ORIGIN]) for the connection within
   which it occurs.

   The ORIGIN frame is sent from servers to clients on the server's
   control stream.

   The layout and semantics of the frame payload are identical to those
   of the HTTP/2 frame defined in [ORIGIN].  The ORIGIN frame type is
   0xc (decimal 12), as in HTTP/2.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations beyond those
   discussed in [ALTSVC] and [HTTP3].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers two frame types in the "HTTP/3 Frame Type"
   registry ([HTTP3]).

                  +------------+-------+---------------+
                  | Frame Type | Value | Specification |
                  +============+=======+===============+
                  | ALTSVC     |  0xa  | Section 3     |
                  +------------+-------+---------------+
                  | ORIGIN     |  0xc  | Section 4     |
                  +------------+-------+---------------+
