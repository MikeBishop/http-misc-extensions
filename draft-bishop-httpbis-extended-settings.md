--- abstract

HTTP/2 defines the SETTINGS frame to contain a single 32-bit value per 
setting. While this is sufficient to convey everything used in the core 
HTTP/2 specification, some protocols will require more complex values, 
such as arrays of code-points or strings. 

For such protocols, this extension defines a parallel to the SETTINGS 
frame, EXTENDED_SETTINGS, where the value of a setting is not a 32-bit 
value, but a variable-length opaque data blob whose interpretation is 
subject entirely to the definition of the protocol using it.

# Introduction        {#problems}

In [I-D.bishop-httpbis-http2-additional-certs], values
for which IANA registries already exist must be communicated between
two HTTP/2 implementations.  Since the SETTINGS frame constrains
setting values to a 32-bit value, the existing version of that
draft divides the 32-bit value into halves and dedicates bits
to each currently-known value.  This requires the creation
of two duplicative IANA registries, and enormously constrains
future extensibility since each future supported value will consume
one of only sixteen bits.  It also causes divergence from other
places in the protocol where a bitmask is not required and a
more sensible value can be used.

[MS-HTTP2E], likewise, defines a very limited bitmap in the 32-bit
value -- two bits are defined, all others are reserved (and not useful).
The setting fits easily in a single byte, and need not consume a four-byte
value every time it is transferred.

Alternately, a number of recent and in-progress HTTP/2 extensions 
describe properties of the connection that are informative to the peer 
([RFC7838], [I-D.ietf-httpbis-origin-frame]). These are essentially 
settings that did not fit into a 32-bit value. 

Each extension could define its own SETTINGS-equivalent frame to carry 
its own data, as these extensions already have, but to do so every time 
a new extension might require such a capability seems similarly 
wasteful, given the limited frame type space (also an IANA registry).

# Detection of Support {#setting}

An HTTP/2 peer that supports the EXTENDED_SETTINGS frame indicate this using the HTTP/2 `SETTINGS_EXTENDED_SETTINGS` 
(0xSETTING-TBD) setting. 

The initial value for the `SETTINGS_EXTENDED_SETTINGS` setting is 0 (0x00), 
indicating that the peer does not support the EXTENDED_SETTINGS frame.
A peer that is able to parse the EXTENDED_SETTINGS frame MUST set this value
to 1 (0x01).

This setting MUST be sent before any of the frame types in {{frames}} are
sent, but those frames MAY be sent before the setting is acknowledged and
MAY be sent regardless of whether the peer has sent this setting.

# Extension Frame Types {#frames}

## EXTENDED_SETTINGS Frame  {#settings-frame}

The EXTENDED_SETTINGS frame (type=0xTBD1) conveys configuration parameters that
affect how endpoints communicate, such as preferences and constraints
on peer behavior which occur in a form other than a 32-bit value.
The EXTENDED_SETTINGS frame is also used to acknowledge the
receipt of those parameters.  Individually, an EXTENDED_SETTINGS parameter can
also be referred to as a "setting".

EXTENDED_SETTINGS parameters are not negotiated; they describe characteristics
of the sending peer, which are used by the receiving peer.  However, a negotiation
can be implied by the use of EXTENDED_SETTINGS -- a peer uses EXTENDED_SETTINGS
to advertise a set of supported values.  The recipient can then choose which
entries from this list are also acceptable and proceed with the value it has
chosen.  (This choice could be announced in a field of an extension frame, or in
a value in SETTINGS.)

Different values for the same parameter can be advertised by each peer.  For
example, a server might support many different signing algorithms, while
a resource constrained client has only one or two that it can validate.

An EXTENDED_SETTINGS frame MAY be sent at any time by either endpoint over
the lifetime of the connection.

Each parameter in an EXTENDED_SETTINGS frame replaces any existing value for
that parameter.  Parameters are processed in the order in which they
appear, and a receiver of an EXTENDED_SETTINGS frame does not need to maintain
any state other than the current value of its parameters.  Therefore,
the value of a EXTENDED_SETTINGS parameter is the last value that is seen by a
receiver.

EXTENDED_SETTINGS parameters can request acknowledgement by the receiving peer.  To
enable this, the EXTENDED_SETTINGS frame defines the following flag:

REQUEST_ACK (0x1):
: When set, bit 0 indicates that this frame contains values which the 
sender wants to know were understood and applied. For more information,
see {{synchronization}}.

Like SETTINGS frames, EXTENDED_SETTINGS frames always apply to a 
connection, never a single stream. The stream identifier for an 
EXTENDED_SETTINGS frame MUST be zero (0x0). If an endpoint receives an 
EXTENDED_SETTINGS frame whose stream identifier field is anything other 
than 0x0, the endpoint MUST respond with a connection error (Section 
5.4.1) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR. 

The EXTENDED_SETTINGS frame affects connection state.  A badly formed or
incomplete EXTENDED_SETTINGS frame MUST be treated as a connection error
(Section 5.4.1) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

### EXTENDED_SETTINGS Format

The payload of a SETTINGS frame consists of zero or more parameters, 
each consisting of an unsigned 16-bit setting identifier and a
length-prefixed binary value.

{: #fig-ext-settings title="EXTENDED_SETTINGS frame payload"}

In some cases (e.g. indications of feature support), the presence and 
acknowledgement of a setting may be sufficient, and a value superfluous. 
In order to accomodate such cases, implementations MUST track 
identifiers with zero-length values differently from never-seen 
identifiers.  The initial value of each setting is "never-seen."

An implementation MUST ignore the contents for any EXTENDED_SETTINGS
identifier it does not understand.

## EXTENDED_SETTINGS_ACK Frame {#ack}

The EXTENDED_SETTINGS_ACK frame acknowledges
receipt and application of specific values in the peer's SETTINGS frame.
It contains a list of EXTENDED_SETTINGS identifiers which the sender
has understood and applied. This list MAY be empty.

Any EXTENDED_SETTINGS_ACK frame whose length is not a multiple of
two bytes MUST be treated as a connection error ([RFC7540] section 5.4.1)
of type `FRAME_SIZE_ERROR`.

# Settings Synchronization {#synchronization}

Some values in EXTENDED_SETTINGS benefit from or require an 
understanding of when the peer has received and applied the changed 
parameter values. In order to provide such synchronization timepoints, 
the recipient of a EXTENDED_SETTINGS frame MUST apply the updated 
parameters as soon as possible upon receipt. The values in the 
EXTENDED_SETTINGS frame MUST be processed in the order they appear, with 
no other frame processing between values. Unsupported parameters MUST be 
ignored.

Once all values have been processed, if the REQUEST_ACK flag was set, 
the recipient MUST immediately emit a EXTENDED_SETTINGS_ACK frame 
listing the identifiers whose values were understood and applied. (If 
none of the values were understood, the EXTENDED_SETTINGS_ACK frame will 
be empty, but MUST still be sent.) Upon receiving an 
EXTENDED_SETTINGS_ACK frame, the sender of the altered parameters can 
rely on the setting having been applied. 

If the sender of an EXTENDED_SETTINGS frame with the `REQUEST_ACK` flag 
set does not receive an acknowledgement from a peer that has sent the 
`SETTINGS_EXTENDED_SETTINGS` setting within a reasonable amount of time, 
it MAY issue a connection error ([RFC7540] Section 5.4.1) of type 
SETTINGS_TIMEOUT. This error MUST NOT be sent if the peer has not 
previously advertised support for EXTENDED_SETTINGS. 

# Security Considerations {#security}

Because these frames can be used to request that peers retain potentially-large
state, implementations need to use caution in their retention policies.  Values
which are not understood MUST be discarded in order to protect against increased
memory usage.  Specifications which make use of EXTENDED_SETTINGS MUST include details
about how the contents can be parsed and stored, and SHOULD include details about
how the information can be compressed and when it can safely be discarded.

# IANA Considerations {#iana}

This draft establishes one new registry and add three entries across two existing registries.

The HTTP/2 `SETTINGS_EXTENDED_SETTINGS` setting is registered in {{iana-setting}}.
Two frame types are registered in {{iana-frame}}.

## Signature Methods {#iana-extended-settings-values}

This document establishes a registry for HTTP/2 extended settings.  The
"HTTP/2 Extended Settings" registry manages a 16-bit space.  The "HTTP/2
Extended Settings" registry operates under the "Expert Review" policy
[RFC5226] for values in the range from 0x0000 to 0xefff, with values
between and 0xf000 and 0xffff being reserved for Experimental Use.

New registrations are advised to provide the following information:

Name:
: A symbolic name for the setting.  Specifying a setting name is
optional.

Code:
: The 16-bit code assigned to the setting.

Specification:  An optional reference to a specification that
describes the use of the setting.

No entries are registered by this document.

## HTTP/2 SETTINGS_HTTP_CERT_AUTH Setting {#iana-setting}

The `SETTINGS_EXTENDED_SETTINGS` setting is registered in the "HTTP/2 Settings"
registry established in [RFC7540].

Name:
: SETTINGS_EXTENDED_SETTINGS

Code:
: 0xSETTING-TBD

Initial Value:
: 0

Specification:
: This document.

## New HTTP/2 Frames {#iana-frame}

Two new frame types are registered in the "HTTP/2 Frame Types" registry 
established in [RFC7540]. The entries in the following table are 
registered by this document. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~
+-----------------------+--------------+-------------------------+
| Frame Type            | Code         | Specification           |
+-----------------------+--------------+-------------------------+
| EXTENDED_SETTINGS     | 0xFRAME-TBD1 | {{settings-frame}}      |
| EXTENDED_SETTINGS_ACK | 0xFRAME-TBD2 | {{ack}}                 |
